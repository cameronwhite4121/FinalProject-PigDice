# Pig Dice
Pig dice is a game you play with a friend, with the goal being to reach 100 points first
## Rules
The rules are simple
 - First player to reach 100 points wins
 - Roll the dice until the player decides to hold
 - Each roll of the dice nets the player points equal to what they roll
 - But if the player rolls a 1, then their turn ends and lose all points that turn
 - If the player holds, the turn ends and they keep all points earned that turn
